Vision
======

The long-term vision of Metrasynth is to create new ways to interact with the
SunVox app, the SunVox DLL, and the SunVox file format.

We'll do so by following these principles:

Leverage SunVox
===============

Whenever SunVox can do something by itself, let it do so.

Expose SunVox
=============

Whatever the SunVox DLL and file format can do, you should be able to access
it using Python in expressive object-oriented and/or functional ways.

Embed SunVox
============

Whatever ``sunsynth`` file you can create, you should be able to load as
an instrument in a DAW using a freely available VST or similar plugin.

Explore SunVox
==============

Reach the limits of SunVox's capabilities. Report these findings
back to the community, and internalize them in Metrasynth tools.

Extend SunVox
=============

Create tools that use the SunVox format and DLL, but provide novel
capabilities that are not feasible using the standard SunVox UI,
nor using SunVox via another pre-existing DAW.

Respect SunVox
==============

Show respect for Alexander Zolotov, creator of SunVox, who graciously provides
his expertly-crafted audio engine as a beautiful cross-platform UI, as well
as a commercially useful, zero-cost DLL.

Show respect for all members of the SunVox community, which has grown a
healthy culture of sharing and experimentation.
