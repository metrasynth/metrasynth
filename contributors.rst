Matthew got his introduction to electronic music circa 1993, primarily
through the tracker scene.

In 2016, after trying simulators such as SchismTracker, he discovered SunVox,
and promptly wondered why he hadn't discovered it sooner!

Once he tried an experiment using Python and the SunVox DLL,
he became ecstatic and decided to embark on a mission to not only
make the most of that resource, but to also share as much as possible
with the SunVox community.
